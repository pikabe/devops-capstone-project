As a developer
I need to add REST APIs for reading, updating, deleting, and listing customer accounts to the existing Python Flask-based microservice
So that the account microservice can fully manage customer accounts on the e-commerce website.

### Details and Assumptions
The database model for customer accounts has already been developed.
The Python Flask-based microservice already includes an endpoint to create customer accounts.

### Acceptance Criteria     
Given the existing Python Flask-based microservice with an endpoint to create customer accounts,
When I add REST APIs for reading, updating, deleting, and listing customer accounts,
Then the microservice should be capable of performing CRUD operations on customer accounts.
